## Hello!

I am working as a data science consultant in Data & Analytics practice at [Slalom Consulting, LLC](https://www.slalom.com). I graduated with a PhD in statistical physics from Virginia Tech in Dec. 2018, where I worked on [Application of Network Reliability to Analyze Diffusive Processes on Graph Dynamical Systems](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/86841) with [Prof. Stephen Eubank](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/person/stephen-eubank).


###  Interests
Machine Learning algorithms, Data Engineering and Data Architecture pipelines,
Computational models for interacting dynamical systems, Computational Epidemiology,
Scalable algorithms to calibrate large scale network models, Experiment design.


### Recent Invited Talk
[NASA PCE3 (Prebiotic Chemistry and Early Earth Environments) Virtual Workshop 2022 Nano- to Cosmic- Studies of Complex Systems](http://prebioticchem.info/workshops/workshop2.html) Network reliability: a generic tool to explore diffusive processes on interacting systems, University of Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI, Oct. 20, 2022.
