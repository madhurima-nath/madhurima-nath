## Hello!

I am a statistical physicist by training, working as a data science consultant in Data & Analytics at Slalom, LLC. I have a PhD from Virginia Tech in Dec. 2018, where I worked on [Application of Network Reliability to Analyze Diffusive Processes on Graph Dynamical Systems](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/86841) with [Prof. Stephen Eubank](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/person/stephen-eubank).
